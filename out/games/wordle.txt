He released it publicly in October 2021, and by January 2022 it had grown from 90 daily players to over 300,000. The New York Times purchased Wordle in January 2022 for a price reported in the low seven figures. The game's viral spread was driven by its shareable emoji grid — players could post their results without spoiling the answer, creating a global daily ritual. Wordle's design is a masterclass in constraint-based game design. Six guesses, five letters, one word per day — these limitations create a shared experience that connects millions of players worldwide. The color feedback system (green for correct position, yellow for wrong position, gray for not in word) is intuitive yet strategically rich. Choosing the right starting word is itself a subject of intense debate among players, with CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, and RAISE among the most popular choices based on letter frequency analysis. The game has spawned hundreds of variants: Quordle (four words at once), Wordle Unlimited (play anytime), Nerdle (math equations), Heardle (music), and many more. But the original remains the gold standard — a perfectly balanced daily puzzle that takes about three minutes to play and generates conversation worldwide. Whether you're a casual player or a dedicated optimizer tracking your win streaks, Wordle offers a uniquely satisfying daily mental workout.a:["slug","wordle","d"]
