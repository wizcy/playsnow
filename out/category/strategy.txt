4:T5a8,Connect Four was invented by Howard Wexler and Ned Strongin and first sold by Milton Bradley in 1974. The game's genius lies in its perfect balance: the rules take seconds to learn, but the strategy runs surprisingly deep. Players alternate dropping colored discs into a 7-column, 6-row vertical grid, and the first to align four discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. In 1988, mathematicians James Dow Allen and Victor Allis independently proved that Connect Four is a solved game — the first player can always force a win with perfect play. Despite being solved, the game remains enormously popular because human players rarely play perfectly, making every game a genuine contest. Connect Four has sold over 40 million copies worldwide and is a staple of family game nights, school classrooms, and competitive puzzle communities. The game teaches fundamental strategic concepts: controlling the center, creating multiple threats simultaneously, and blocking opponent setups before they become dangerous. The vertical drop mechanic adds a unique constraint not found in most grid games — you can't place a disc just anywhere, only at the top of each column's current stack. This creates fascinating tactical puzzles where the order of moves matters as much as their positions. Whether you're playing casually or studying the game's deep theory, Connect Four offers a uniquely satisfying blend of accessibility and strategic depth.5:T5fe,Checkers, known as Draughts outside North America, is one of the oldest board games still played today. Its origins trace back to around 1400 AD in southern France, evolving from an earlier game called Alquerque. The modern 8×8 board version was standardized in the 16th century. In 2007, computer scientists at the University of Alberta announced that checkers had been solved — their program Chinook proved that perfect play from both sides always results in a draw. This made checkers the most complex game ever solved at the time. Despite being solved, checkers remains a beloved game worldwide. The World Checkers/Draughts Federation governs international competition, and the game is played in over 100 countries. American checkers (the most common variant) uses an 8×8 board with 12 pieces per side. Pieces move diagonally forward and must jump over opponent pieces to capture them. When a piece reaches the opposite end of the board, it becomes a King and can move both forward and backward. The game rewards long-term planning, sacrifice tactics, and positional awareness. A key concept is the 'tempo' — controlling the pace of exchanges to force your opponent into unfavorable positions. Checkers also teaches the value of piece activity: a passive piece that can't move is nearly worthless, while an active piece that threatens multiple captures controls the game. Whether you're learning strategy games for the first time or sharpening your tactical thinking, checkers offers a perfect blend of simplicity and depth.7:["slug","strategy","d"]
