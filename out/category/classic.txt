The Nokia 6110 version, programmed by Taneli Armanto, introduced an entire generation to mobile gaming. Today, Snake remains one of the most recognized and beloved games in history, with Google even featuring a playable version in search results.","howToPlay":{"desktop":"Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction. The snake moves continuously — you only change its direction. Eat the red food dots to grow longer and earn points. Avoid hitting the walls or your own tail. The game gets progressively harder as your snake grows longer, leaving less room to maneuver.","mobile":"Swipe in any direction to change the snake's heading.

On our 20×20 grid, the theoretical maximum is filling every cell, which would give you a score of around 3980 points. In practice, scores above 500 are impressive."},{"question":"Why is Snake so popular?","answer":"Snake's appeal lies in its perfect simplicity — anyone can understand the rules in seconds, but mastering it takes real skill. It was also one of the first mobile games ever, reaching hundreds of millions of Nokia phone users in the late 1990s."},{"question":"Is this the same Snake from Nokia phones?","answer":"This is a faithful recreation of the classic Snake gameplay.
