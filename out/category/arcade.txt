4:T5c5,Breakout was designed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak for Atari and released in 1976. The game was a direct evolution of Pong — instead of two paddles, one player controls a single paddle at the bottom of the screen, bouncing a ball upward to destroy rows of bricks. The story goes that Jobs was given four days to design the game and promised Wozniak half the bonus if he could reduce the chip count. Wozniak, working through the night, created a design using just 44 chips — a feat so elegant that Atari engineers initially didn't believe it was real. Breakout became one of Atari's best-selling arcade games and directly inspired Taito's Arkanoid in 1986, which added power-ups and became its own phenomenon. The core mechanic — a ball that bounces off surfaces and destroys targets — has influenced countless games across every genre. Today, Breakout-style games remain a staple of casual gaming, beloved for their satisfying physics and escalating tension as the ball speeds up. The game rewards both quick reflexes and spatial awareness. As bricks disappear, the ball's trajectory becomes harder to predict, and the paddle must cover more ground. Clearing the top rows first is a common strategy, but letting the ball get behind the brick wall for rapid destruction is the ultimate skill move. Whether you're a retro gaming enthusiast or discovering it for the first time, Breakout delivers pure arcade satisfaction that has stood the test of nearly five decades.6:["slug","arcade","d"]

Wozniak engineered the hardware in just four days, creating an unusually efficient design. The game was a major commercial success and directly influenced the entire brick-breaker genre."},{"question":"What is the difference between Breakout and Arkanoid?","answer":"Arkanoid (1986) is a direct sequel concept to Breakout, adding power-ups, enemy ships, and multiple levels. Breakout is the pure original — just a ball, paddle, and bricks. Both are classics, but Breakout's simplicity is part of its timeless appeal."},{"question":"How do I control the ball's direction?","answer":"The ball's angle depends on where it hits your paddle. Hitting with the center sends it straight up. Hitting with the left edge sends it left, and the right edge sends it right. Mastering this angle control is the key skill in Breakout."},{"question":"Does the ball speed up?","answer":"Yes! The ball gradually speeds up as you play, increasing the challenge. This is a deliberate design choice from the original 1976 arcade game — it creates natural difficulty progression without changing the rules."}]}}]]}]]}],null],null],null]},[null,["$","$L5",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","category","children","$6","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L7",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined"}]],null]},[null,["$","$L5",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","category","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L7",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined"}]],null]},[[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/0d7d149c2d11c317.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":[["$","head",null,{"children":["$","$L8",null,{}]}],["$","body",null,{"className":"bg-gray-900
