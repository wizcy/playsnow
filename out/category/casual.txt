It became the most downloaded free app in January 2014, earning an estimated $50,000 per day from ads. Nguyen famously removed it from app stores in February 2014, saying it was 'too addictive.' Its brutal difficulty and one-tap gameplay made it a cultural phenomenon.","howToPlay":{"desktop":"Press Space or click to make the bird flap upward. Gravity constantly pulls the bird down. Navigate through gaps between green pipes by timing your flaps carefully. Each pipe you pass scores one point. A single collision ends the game instantly.","mobile":"Tap anywhere on the screen to flap. The timing between taps determines your altitude. Tap too fast and you'll fly too high; tap too slow and you'll sink. Find the rhythm to glide through each gap."},"features":["One-touch controls — tap to flap","Extreme difficulty that keeps you coming back","Instant restart for quick retries","Score counter to track your best run","Smooth physics-based flight mechanics"],"tips":["Focus on the gaps, not the pipes","Develop a consistent tapping rhythm rather than reacting to each pipe","Stay in the middle of the screen when possible — it gives you room to adjust","Don't tap too rapidly — gentle, spaced taps give better control","The first few pipes are the hardest because you haven't found your rhythm yet"],"faq":[{"question":"Why was Flappy Bird removed from app stores?","answer":"Creator Dong Nguyen removed it in February 2014, tweeting 'I cannot take this anymore.' He said the game's addictive nature was causing problems for players and he felt guilty about it, despite earning $50,000/day from ads."},{"question":"What is a good score in Flappy Bird?","answer":"Getting past 10 pipes is respectable for beginners. A score of 50+ is considered skilled, and 100+ is expert level. The world record is over 999, achieved by dedicated players who practiced for hundreds of hours."},{"question":"Can I play Flappy Bird on my phone?","answer":"Yes! This browser version works on all mobile devices. Just tap the screen to flap. It plays identically to the original mobile app."}]}}],["$","$L3","tic-tac-toe",{"game":{"slug":"tic-tac-toe","title":"Tic Tac Toe","description":"The classic X and O game.
